"""
In this question, you need to:
1) Implement the linear_regression() procedure using gradient descent.
   You can use the SGDRegressor class from sklearn, since this class uses gradient descent.
2) Select features (in the predictions procedure) and make predictions.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subset (~50%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this exercise on your own computer, locally.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number of features or fewer iterations.
