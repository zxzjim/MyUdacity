In this question, you need to:
1) implement the linear_regression() procedure
2) Select features (in the predictions procedure) and make predictions.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~10%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this exercise on your own computer, locally. If you do, you may want to complete Exercise
    8 using gradient descent, or limit your number of features to 10 or so, since ordinary
    least squares can be very slow for a large number of features.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number of features.
